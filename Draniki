12 potatoes
1 onion
oil
salt
Peel, wash and grate potatoes and the onion (the onion will help you keep grated potatoes from turning brown). Use a grater with small holes. Add salt and mix until a smooth even consistency is obtained.

Heat the frying pan with vegetable oil. Put a full tablespoon of mixture from the bowl onto the frying pan and form a small pancake. Flip over once browned and crispy - about 2 to 3 minutes each side.

Serve hot with sour cream.
